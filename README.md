This repository is a collaborative space for reticulum enthusiasts to contribute resources and projects for the Chicagoland Reticulum Network website. Our goal is to improve access to reticulum by offering valuable learning resources, collaborating, and connecting communities. 

## Reticulum Community Resource Hub

Welcome to the Reticulum Community Resource Hub! This repository is designed to allow contributors to share their work related to reticulum, which will be linked to the [Chicagoland Reticulum Network website](http://www.reticulum.world).

## Project Status and Goal

Our primary goal is to enhance access to reticulum resources and foster community collaboration. There is a noticeable gap in available information about reticulum compared to more popular mesh networks like Meshtastic. Navigating the documentation can be challenging, and there is limited content to guide newcomers interested in reticulum. Additionally, finding dedicated community spaces for the project can be difficult.

Reticulum's philosophy resonates with the current global climate, emphasizing the importance of privacy rightsâ€”a fundamental human right, not a political statement. 

In addition to our technical objectives, we aim to raise awareness of this lesser-known technology and assist newcomers in navigating the project. We are all continuously learning and experimenting together, and we hope that our website dedicated to reticulum sparks curiosity and provides everything needed to get started.

*This project is in its early stages, but we will be continuously updating and improving this repository, so please check back often for new contributions and resources.*

Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated as we work together to enhance access to reticulum!

## Website

Our grand vision is to build a nexus for regional reticulum networks for both on- and off-grid communications. We believe that reticulum significantly surpasses other mesh networks, yet it remains less accessible to the average person. The learning curve for reticulum is steeper, and the protocol has not received as much attention as simpler alternatives like Meshtastic.

We recognize that this gap in content, guides, and community support can hinder potential users. Our website aims to assist those who have struggled to find answers and community when learning about reticulum. While still under construction, it will be an ongoing community project. 

Reticulum is more versatile than other mesh networks like Meshtastic or MeshCore. Its complexity necessitates more coverage, which is currently lacking. We hope that as we progress with our [website](http://www.reticulum.world), we will inspire more individuals to engage with the project and connect with the community!

Feel free to join our [Chicagoland Reticulum Signal group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIJ03-p0SA40-0GolMCK057vA3dVBcwVA7Y6lPKUe8Bq9EhDWsSwKeoy9fGTVWwjnd-W7); we would love to have you. If you have an interest in or would like to help with this project, your support would be greatly appreciated!

**Note:** This project is a work in progress and will be updated shortly. Your patience and contributions are invaluable as we continue to enhance this resource for the reticulum community.
